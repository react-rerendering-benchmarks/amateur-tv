= Content Management Policy and Procedures =

The company is absolutely committed to ensure that no underage people participate in any of broadcasted or published materials through our websites. Also in this line, we have published a clear list of topics, items and vocabulary that cannot be present in the shows, pictures or videos distributed.

Our terms clearly inform the forbidden content. And this is also present at the signed agreement with the content creator. Every person who wants to distribute content must have the legal age verified by our expert 24/7 Monitoring Team, after providing a clear selfie picture including the ID / Passport.

An alert of potential infringement of the authorized content or participants will cause the materials to be frozen immediately and not available to the public view. The 24/7 Monitoring Team will review the reported content carefully and after doing the necessary checks may release it again if it's fully compliant. In the case of confirming non-authorised situations, the data is recorded for periodic reporting and the content may be deleted or sent to the authorities.

Also the account owner is warned and the account may be blocked temporarily or even permanently.

= Age and Identity Verification =

To validate an account, any user must present online their Passport / National ID with a selfie picture, including a random sentence.

This is validated manually by our Monitoring Team to ensure that the picture is legit and has not been altered, the face matches the National ID and that the legal age is met by the person.

If there are doubts the account is not accepted and cannot publish or broadcast therefore.

= Content Monitoring in real-time =

Our 24/7 Monitoring Team reviews random broadcasts to ensure that prohibited content is not emitted. Special attention is paid to all new broadcasts during their first days until a positive track of compliant content is proven. Also the most visited virtual rooms are monitored more often.

Our system scans the chat preventing the publication of URLs and filtering forbidden vocabulary.

We provide our users with a "denounce" button that sends an alert to the 24/7 Monorioting team who will review the reported channel immediately. They have the possibility to cancel the show in case of doubts about the compliance of the show. Or even block the issuer's account temporarily or permanently.
